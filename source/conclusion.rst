In this paper, a parameterizable co-processor for the hardware aided DT induction using an evolutionary approach is proposed. The |cop| co-processor is used for the hardware acceleration of the DT accuracy evaluation task, since this task is proven in the paper to be the execution time bottleneck. The algorithm for full DT induction using evolutionary approach has been implemented in the software to use the |cop| co-processor implemented in the FPGA. The comparison of the HW/SW |ealgo| algorithm implementation with the pure software implementations suggests that the proposed HW/SW architecture offers substantial speedups for all the tests performed on the selected UCI datasets.

In this paper a parameterizable co-processor is proposed which can be used for the hardware aided induction of decision tree (DT) ensembles using EA. The algorithm for the induction of full oblique DT ensembles using EA (|ealgo|) has been chosen to be accelerated since it uses only one individaul per ensemble member for the induction and generates smaller ensemble members with the same or better accuracy then the other well-known DT induction algorithms. Furthermore, it is based on the Bagging algorithm, making it suitable for parallelization. It was shown in the paper that the |ealgo| algorithm spends most of the execution time in DT accuracy evaluation process, hence the |ecop| co-processor was developped to accelerate that task. The |ealgo| algorithm has been implemented in the software and modified to use the |ecop| co-processor implemented in the FPGA as a co-processor. Comparison of the HW/SW implementation of the |ealgo| algorithm with the pure software implementations suggests that the proposed HW/SW architecture offers substantial speedups for all tests performed on selected UCI datasets.
